> In your own words, describe what the 6522 tester code does.

It latches data! So it holds the most previous data inputted into the 0x6000 address. It "latches" AKA holds that data until it is overwritten. In a way, it is a way for the chip to communicate to us, to make reading it easier. (this will be changed.)

> There are some addresses dedicated to using the interface. What are they and what do they seem to do?
> _HINT_: for this part, focus on the wiring of the _address bus lines_.

`TODO`

> Why is creating specific, separate addresses important to achieve this function?

`TODO`

> What is the value of the interface module (i.e. what does it _do_)?
